# FactChecking
## Uni project solving SemEval 2019 Task 8 on Fact-Checking in Community Forums.

Problem description can be found: https://competitions.codalab.org/competitions/20022

Our main inspiration/reference is https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.03178.pdf and their github repo: https://github.com/qcri/QLFactChecking

## Problem short description
There are two subtask in this problem:

### Subtask A
Question classification: determine which class (factual, opinion, socializing) does the question belong to.

Our approach: SVM (probably)

### Subtask B
Answer factuality determination: classify each answer into one of three classes: factual-true, factual-false, non-factual.

Out approach: Based on Fact-checking in community forums by Mihaylova, Nakov (2018), we will use multifaceted model. Our model will address language used in answer; context in which answer is located; external sources support.
Answer content features include subjectivity and credibility analysis
Answerâ€™s context is computed based on cosine similarity to other answers in the current thread
Web support is based on automatic queries which are used to compute cosine similarity with question-answer pair
