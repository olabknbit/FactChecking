Q2_R20	NA	Convert Tourist visa to Family visit visa. Hi all need your help/advice we'll be in Qatar next week; me on a working visa and tourist visa for my family (wife son;daughter). My query is can I convert their tourist visa to family visit visa even I dont have yet a Qatar ID? My profession in visa is Civil Engineer. Thanks in advance..
Q2_R20_C1	True	Dear 1st of all you need to get your RP done &amp; then you can apply for your family visit visa; if approved; then you can convert your family tourist visa to visit visa
Q2_R20_C4	True	Hi Peylenzkie. If my info is not mistaken; you have to apply for RP 1st which takes 10 days or more; then after that; you need to apply your 1 wife to 1 year Family Visit Visa (spouse) which takes 10 days; then convert her Tourist visa to Family Visit Visa (needs Attested Marriage certificate) which takes 3 days. Then lastly; apply for her RP (10 days). So my advice; finish your RP first then apply for their RP later. Tourist visa is 30 days only; not extendable so they have to go out the country.
Q2_R20_C5	True	Please note after getting your RP you need NOC from hotel/sponsor of tourist visa for converting a tourist visa to family visit visa. This document is must.
Q2_R20_C6	True	Requirements for applying Visa for wife:- 1; copy of personal id or passport of the resident husband 2; Letter from husband's employer citing profession and salary 3; copy of attested marriage &amp; child birth certificate 4; copy of wife valid passport For attestation &amp; translation please contact sheen services as they are the best in Qatar who is very flexible; reliable with competitive price.http://sheenservices.com/contact-us.html- ph-44366147/55974495

Q2_R21_C1	False	MAXIMUM 6 MONTHS BROTHER AFTER THAT YOU HAVE TO EXIT FROM QATAR.
Q2_R21_C2	False	After 6 months you can get an extension also....
Q2_R21_C5	False	no extension for tourist visa i think...
Q2_R21_C7	False	you can also extend your tourist visa but very costly as compared with extending a family visit visa. maybe what you can do is exit from qatar then; after three months; apply again for a family visit visa (if you have a relative here)
Q2_R21_C8	False	you can extend a family visit visa for a maximum six months; but in any case that you have to extend it again after your 6 months limit; you can do that; too. i think upto 1 month; more. you just have to submit application form again to immigration with your flight booking details.
Q2_R21_C10	False	you guys are mixing Family visit visa and Tourist visit visa. Family visit visa (when you were sponsored by one of your family member)initially is valid for 1 month; and can be extended later for another 5 months (total 6 months stay) after undergoing Medical examination. Tourist visit visa is is valid for 30 days and can be extended for another 30 days ; 60 days stay in total.
Q2_R46	NA	Visa Extension for My Sister in Law. Dear All; I would like to ask some help/advice from you regarding my sister's in law visa; she is under my sponsorship (family visit visa) and her visa will be expired on Nov.17;2012 (3months from the time she arrive in Doha). My question is; can I still extend her visa for another (1)one month? Please help and advice! Thank you!

Q2_R46_C2	False	Yes you can extend her visa for another 3 months to complete 6 months since she arrives in Qatar .
Q2_R46_C3	False	The above information is not correct. 6 Months Visit visa is only for your direct relatives(blood Relation) if its your wife's relative then its only 3 months; and if you go request for 1 more month showing a ticket they might grant you.
Q2_R46_C5	False	It is correct. 3 mnths for indirect relation and later a month extension after showing a ticket. Go to the Main Immigration.
Q2_R46_C6	False	This NOT new rule it indeed old rules. niece or nephew is consider as direct relatives but sister in law is falls under indirect relatives of yours as she is the sister of your wife. @sms09...you are correct.! anyhow you can still extend her visa of 1 month provided air ticket to the immigration officer; without ticket then sorry to say...no EXTENSION.. Note: if u r kabayan...then PM me..i will tell u best solution for that.

Q2_R80_C4	True	No return ticket is needed for Residency Visit Visa (once again you make it sure with ticket booking agency - ie Akabar/riya or what ever) For your Mother return Ticket is necessary
Q2_R80_C5	False	Dear if it is visit visa return ticket will b necessary for them to come out their country and also to come in to this country. even if u go to buy them ticket they wont give u one way as its visit visa n nt residence visa.. so the better choice if u have a friend working in any agency like etihad or anything try to ask him to provide u two ways ticket then u will pay only one ticket and other ticket will be canceled once ure family reach qatar i mean u will call him n ask him to cancel it once they r here. thats wht my husband did for me.. hope this answer wil help u out.. wish nice trip for ure family.

Q2_R83_C6	False	To sound like a expert . I know for a fact there are only 33 countries that can get upon arrival visit visa Americans are one; it is renewal for 1extra month. Then you must leave Qatar and re enter on new visa. I have been here 10 months; there is no multiple entry visa for Qatar. I had to leave 2 times in 6 months for a few hours to Bahrain until my family visit visa was approved for 6 months. Then work visa.

Q3_R77_C5	False	Nothing to worry. The sad part is you cannot come to Qatar for 2 years.
Q3_R77_C10	False	MM; you have been on a long emergency leave; normally a leave would be for one month; did you officially request your company that they extend your leave to cover this 5 month period that you have been out of the country or has it been absence without permission. do you have email communications etc supporting your request. hope you have a copy of the resignation letter that you had sent to them and the rejection. i am not sure about the rules applicable for a company sponsored individual to come on husband sponsor within the year.
