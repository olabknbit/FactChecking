Q273_R39	NA	Vaccinations needed before i come to Doha? I am in the process of coming over to work in Doha. I wanted to know if their were any specific shots and vaccinations I should get before coming over. I want to try and get these things completed before I leave the US. Any insight would be much appreciated.
Q273_R39_C1	True	Yes there are; though it varies depending on which country you come from. In the UK; the doctor has a list of all countries and the vaccinations needed for each. I'll imagine they have the same in the US.
Q273_R39_C2	True	I suggest going to visit your local GP and mention that you are moving to Qatar. They should have in their system what shots you need before coming over. It is usually for hepatitis and thyfoid i think (please excuse the spelling)
Q273_R39_C4	True	It depends what you have had already. You don't specifically need any extra vaccinations as long as you are up to date with the usual ones you have in the UK (not sure about US) but you can have Rabies as optional if you want. Although there is no requirement or need to have any extra protection here; it is important to remember that lots of people travel East on holidays and if you do you will need the standard typhoid; yellow fever; etc. Children need to have been vaccinated against TB before they can start school. In the UK they no longer give BCG so important to get that done before you come.
Q273_R39_C8	True	As I said; the official advice is that you don't HAVE to; however; they may offer you Rabies; Typhoid and Hep B as an option. As they no longer boost Tetanus as routine; you would have to have a booster before coming. That said; the UK has a vey hands off approach to immunisation at the moment as most diseases are sufficiently covered by herd immunity (where because the majority have been vaccinated the people who haven't are covered to a large extent) and cases are low. Personally as long as there is a low risk; I would have all the vaccinations I could; why not?
Q273_R39_C10	True	"We came from here from the US and had Hep A; Typhoid; and Tdap (combined Tetanus; Diptheria; Pertussis) on top of the usual program. The Hep A was a two dose one; given six months apart. We went to our local Kelsey-Seybold clinic there and were given an international certificate of vaccination as approved by the World Health Organisation. *********** ""There's this thing called being so open-minded your brains drop out"". - Richard Dawkins"
Q273_R76	NA	Can I bring my pitbulls to Qatar? I am considering getting a job in Qatar and I have two very well behaved people friendly spayed pitbulls. Apparently this breed is banned. Would I have trouble importing them? If anything happened to the dogs; my husband would die; and he will not leave them in Canada if we go away. So I have to be sure they would be ok to be imported before considering taking a job.
Q273_R76_C1	False	If they are 'banned'; as you suggest; then it obviously means that your are not allowed to bring them into Qatar.
Q273_R76_C2	True	"they are definitely banned in Qatar... so as LP said; how do you want to import something which is banned? Custom is not going to let them in... frankly speaking; for me it sounds a bit nonsense ""very well behaved people friendly pitbulls"".. as for me; these two don't come together; it's EITHER ""very well behaved people friendly"" or ""pitbulls"".. sorry; eh?... hope your husband won't be able to figure out my real name and address.. :)"
Q273_R76_C10	False	Yes you can bring it but be careful this kind of dog is very very very dangerous. Because I have one that my friend brought it to my last year from Kuwait. You can talk to Doha Airport to be sure about that.
Q274_R68	NA	how cold is doha during winter? i am just curious how cold is doha during winter?
Q274_R68_C3	False	8-10 degrees i guess?? more than the temp its the wind that makes u go crazy...
Q274_R68_C6	False	In 2006 it was a lovely winter. It was dark; cloudy and rained for almost every day in December. We got trapped in Doha on new years eve and were unable to get to Dukhan such was the torrential rain. It rained on and off until April and then warmed up. The coldest night was 5C but generally 7C. I remember it rained when my parents were here and that was April 2007. This last winter wasn't very cold at all; only a few days of rain and never really got below 10C at night. I love winters here; they are so cosy. On the down side; houses are not built for winter so prepare to freeze and get leaks driping everywhere. The roads don't drain very well so very wet.

Q277_R4	NA	child seat belts. While driving in Doha last night I witness a sad incident. A man was driving with his child on his lap. He had to make an emergency stop and his childs head impacted the steering wheel. The poor child was bleeding and crying. Many times I have seen children not properly secured in vehicles. Is there not a law regarding child safety in vehicles here in Qatar?
Q277_R4_C1	True	there is a law. No children under 10 in the front seats. Unfortunately this law is not enforced. Did you take the guys license plate # and report him? Maybe if he got a large fine it would impact him rather than his child. poor child has an idiot for a parent.

Q277_R17	NA	Car seats. What carseat brands are available in Qatar? I&#180;m just not sure if I should bring the kids carseats from Norway; not sure how the airlines will treat the seats; and are a bit worried that they will break them.
Q277_R17_C1	False	"While car seats are available in Qatar; they're bound to be pricier than the ones you have already; and the selection will not exactly ""wow"" you. Unfortunately I can't tell you what brands are available here since I haven't paid them any attention. I brought my two Britax Boulevards with us from the U.S. and they came through fine. I do recommend purchasing car seat travel bags if you can find them in Norway because it will definitely help keep the cloth cover in better shape. If you can't find them; though; the airline will put it in a very heavy-duty plastic bag. Hope that helps; Expat Sue&#241;o P.S. I am starting a Mums and Kids group here in Doha for expats. Be sure to get in touch with me when you arrive (or before if you have any questions). We'll have playgroups; Mums Night Out; and Expectant Moms Group; etc. There are no dues or anything like that. . .just fun :o)"

Q280_R41	NA	what is Homoglobin? Please anone explain me regading Homoglobin bcz Doctor told me your homoglobin is low! thanks
Q280_R41_C1	True	Hemoglobin is the protein molecule in red blood cells that carries oxygen from the lungs to the body's tissues and returns carbon dioxide from the tissues to the lungs. The iron contained in hemoglobin is responsible for the red color of blood. You should eat Alot of green vegitables and salads; your HB will come up dont worry...
Q280_R41_C2	True	Heamoglobin is a component of the blood. If you are deficient in it; it means that if you have an accident or cut yourself; you will bleed easier and for a longer period of time.
Q280_R41_C3	True	Homoglobin is a prejudice against globin....... Its actually haemoglobin; a deficiency can be due to many factors.....if you are deficient you are known as being anaemic...google it for more details....
Q280_R41_C6	True	Hi; I am sure most of the guyz answered your query; if you need more details; read the follwoing: The role of the red blood cells is to carry oxygen through the body. The red blood cells can perform this task because of the presence of hemoglobin; the pigment that is formed when the red blood cells develop in the bone marrow. Each hemoglobin molecule is made up of a protein molecule called globin and four pigmented molecules of a compound called heme. Each heme molecule has one atom of iron; and there are four heme molecules in a single molecule of hemoglobin; hence; a single molecule of hemoglobin has four atoms of iron. This structure makes it possible for one hemoglobin molecule to join with four oxygen molecules to form a substance called oxyhemoglobin. This reaction is reversible; enabling hemoglobin to pick up oxygen when the blood is in the lungs and to release oxygen in the cells when the blood is pumped to the tissues. In general; the blood of men usually has a greater concent
Q280_R41_C7	True	"Hemoglobin is a protein that is carried by red cells. It picks up oxygen in the lungs and delivers it to the peripheral tissues to maintain the viability of cells. Hemoglobin is made from two similar proteins that ""stick together"". Both proteins must be present for the hemoglobin to pick up and release oxygen normally. One of the component proteins is called alpha; the other is beta. Before birth; the beta protein is not expressed. A hemoglobin protein found only during fetal development; called gamma; substitutes up until birth."
Q280_R41_C8	True	Hemoglobin is the protein molecule in red blood cells that carries oxygen from the lungs to Heart and to continue the Inhaling and Exhaling Proccess. They are responsible of Healing any kind of cut ; they stop the blood flow and they are also reponsible to open any kind of plaque inside vains to prevent heart attacks. IF you smoke Hemoglobin will carry the necotin every where it goes because Necotine get stuck on the hemoglobin and reduce its functions so the hemoglobin wont be holding much oxygen in every breathing proccess thats why we see people who smokes breathes more than natural people when they do any activity . There body needs Oxygen but the hemo. aint functioning in the way they have to .
Q280_R41_C9	True	"Hemoglabin is one of spideman's enemy.. oh i think that's greengoblin. just kidding; Definition of Hemoglabin Hem""o*glo""bin (?); n. [Hemo- + globe.] (Physiol.) The normal coloring matter of the red blood corpuscles of vertebrate animals. It is composed of hematin and globulin; and is also called h&#230;matoglobulin. In arterial blood; it is always combined with oxygen; and is then called oxyhemoglobin. It crystallizes under different forms from different animals; and when crystallized; is called h&#230;matocrystallin."

Q306_R20	NA	Experience necessary for NHA License?? Hello guys..I want to take NHA licensure(Nurse) here in Qatar but I dont have any work experience in the Philippines..I'm currently working here now as a nurse in a construction company for almost 1yr..Will NHA allowed me to take licensure here even if I don't have the necessary experience required? Help please..thanks a lot and godbless..
Q306_R20_C1	False	You must have two years of work experience to apply for the license. You can work for another year and carry on with it. Since you are on company sponsorship I think you can work for another year and then apply. Hope this helps
Q306_R20_C4	True	You might have a problem getting an NHA license because of lack of experience. Your employer might even be in trouble for employing you even though you don't have a license to work as nurse here in Qatar.
Q306_R20_C6	True	You shouldn't be working ANYWHERE in Qatar WITHOUT an NHA license;so continuing in your current job for another year &amp; then showing that to NHA as work experience may not be the best idea because as of now you are working ILLEGALLY!...you need to have minimum 2 years work experience OUTSIDE Qatar before coming here;if you could be employed legally here without an NHA license;what's the point of them conducting the exam???...so if you want to legally work in Qatar;go back to your home country(doesn't matter where as long as you work LEGALLY.);get two years LEGAL work experience then come back here;get your degree;certificates &amp; work experience reviewed by Dataflow;then apply to take the licensure exam...
Q306_R20_C8	True	I think work experience is not a prerequisite for taking the NHA exam that is now handled by Prometric. You can try to schedule the exam online. However; there's no point of taking the exam without the required work experience since it is one of the requirements to get NHA license. Moreover; if you pass the exam; the validity is only for 2 years; otherwise you have to take it again.

Q363_R58_C2	True	Qatar is paying more salary
Q363_R58_C3	False	I think it is qatar but I think bcos it is also the most costly place in gulf.
Q363_R58_C5	True	I would say Qatar is paying more salary as compare to other gulf countries.
Q363_R58_C6	False	I think it depends on your job but I would say the best payers are Saudi Arabia closely followed by Kuwait but neither of those places are pleasant enough to endure just for a few more bills in your pay cheque. The UAE pays ok and Abu Dhabi is a cheaper and more interesting place to live than Qatar.
Q363_R58_C8	False	Yeah; may be Qatar. Simply because of the cost of living compared to other GCC countries much higher here. Saudi is not paying good salary for the workers. But the workers can enjoy free food and accommodation there with majority of employers.

Q365_R13	NA	Work Permit. How many days does it take to finish the processing of a Work Permit?
Q365_R13_C1	False	Just today i went for the workpermit medical. I think the process works as follows: 1. Your company applies online for WP and you get a piece of paper that it is issued. - Max 1 week. 2. They get a medical date - another week max. 3. Finger printing - another 3-4 days. 4. WP card - another 2-3 days. above days are just from my personal experience and may vary.
Q365_R13_C4	False	these are two different things.. Tepgam67 is asking about Work permit while being on Family visa. shapil is talking about residence permit. that's what happens when unprofessional people try to give an advice. Tepgam67; if you have an RP here; to obtain a Work permit you need police clearance and the contract certified in MOL. How long it takes to finalize the process depends on several factors. ometimes it takes 3-4 days; sometimes it takes 1 month and even more. If you don't have an RP here (i.e. you are on 6 months family visa); you cannot work; and therefore you cannot obtain a Work permit.

Q375_R1_C5	True	There is a regulated nursery service in doha but at premium rates and difficult to obtain a place; and now due to new regulations there are a reduced number of places. but with careful search you should be able to find a Nursery place. Do ask to see their Ministry registration. Outside of this there is the home provision by employing a Nanny; which is a costly activity initially. There is also many who will offer the service privately unregulated. Its your choice who you trust this small child with. Child care should be planned proir to the babys birth. we have nine months to plan for this day and children deserve the best decisions from us . check Doha Mums website . good Luck.
