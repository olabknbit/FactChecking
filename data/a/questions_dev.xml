			<RelQBody>Is Qatar out of Coins? I have noticed that many businesses here in Qatar instead of giving the proper change back on a purchase; they try to give a candy or some gum. And the prices are always conveniently priced at a little over .50. The clerk always says sorry Sr. We have no change or the boss tells us to give the gum. It&#8217;s a great way for them to earn extra. When they offer me the gum I tell them I will use my ATM card</RelQBody>

			<RelQSubject>BEST service apartments/condos in WEST BAY</RelQSubject>
			<RelQBody>Hi! I would immensely appreciate any good advice on service apartments/condos in West Bay area. Possibly; just walking distance or nearest to Doha Towers. What's the usual price range for this? I'm looking at 1-2 bedroom; fully furnished; with kitchen and washing area (of course). P.S. Could someone help please? I've been posting this query the third time now; and yet to get an answer. Please; please; please. =)</RelQBody>
