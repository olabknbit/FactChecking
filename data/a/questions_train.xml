			<RelQSubject>Best butter chicken in Doha is...?</RelQSubject>
			<RelQBody>I've been in Doha for quite a while now; but I still haven't experienced really authentic butter chicken like the ones you get in India. The butter chicken over here is a bit bland to serve the arabian palate and doesn't do the dish justice. Any suggestions where you can get the real deal? FYI I've been to Shaalimaar (the Indian restaurant near the airport); Bukhara and AliShaan but none of them cut it; for me at least.</RelQBody>

			<RelQSubject>Question about wife's visa</RelQSubject>
			<RelQBody>I will be arriving in Doha on the 10th or 11th of December. My wife will be flying in approximately two weeks later and will be staying with me on my sponsorship for the duration of my contract. When she steps off of the plane in Doha; she will have her passport; but I don't know what else she needs in order to stay in the country with me. Can she get some sort of visitor visa or what? I am not sure what to do here. thanks everyone.</RelQBody>

			<RelQBody>Am I the only one who seems to experience a problem with taxis that don't slow down to pick you up; when quite obviously you are waiting for their service? It has happened to me a number of times where about 2 or 3 taxis bypass me; even after I have waved them down. It makes no sense. Why on earth would they just keep driving? Surely they are contractually bound to pick up fares if they are on duty? Is anyone else finding the same thing X</RelQBody>

			<RelQBody>Hey everyone; Someone once said to me that somewhere that relies on the names of roundabouts for directions is probably lacking something in culture. Very unfair; I think; but it's got me thinking: what slang and nicknames exist in Qatar? I think everyone's heard of 'Cholesterol Corner'; but does everyone know where 'Big Switzerland' is? I'd love to do a feature on this for the paper; so any suggestions; please let me know. Cheers. Joe write2joewilliams@yahoo.co.uk</RelQBody>

			<RelQSubject>Scientology in Qatar</RelQSubject>
			<RelQBody>I was very surprised to see Scientology - trying to get converts in Qatar This belief system is banned in some countries such as Germany (i think) and the founder openly ridicules Islam. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZbT6bQi-1bw The founder's books are available at the book fair - near the AWQAF (ministry of islam) stand....at the front entrance. So if you were offended by the Danish cartoon.... this is much worse and these people are here with their books!</RelQBody>

			<RelQSubject>Things to do in Qatar for Eid</RelQSubject>
			<RelQBody>Hey! My husband and I have a week off next week and we have decided to stay in Qatar for the week. Does anyone have any suggestions for things to do? We have out own transport (it is a 4x4; but we're not too adventurous when it comes to venturing off road!!) Along with suggestions; your reviews; prices and directions where you can would also be appreciated! We want to spend the week as tourists; rather than expats; so all advice appreciated. Thanks :D Jayne</RelQBody>
